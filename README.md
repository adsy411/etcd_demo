etcd demo
=========

This demo was originally developed for Container Days Boston 2016.  
It consists of 2 etcd setups: api based and volume based.
Both demonstrate a number of components in kubernetes.  We will demonstrate
how failover takes much longer with volumes and the api method is a pretty
reliable way to determine state and config of a given pod.
